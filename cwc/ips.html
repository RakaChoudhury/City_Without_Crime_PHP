The Indian Police Service (IPS) is one of the three All India Services constituted under Article 312 of the Constitution of India. 
It replaced the Indian (Imperial) Police in 1948, a year after India gained independence from Britain.
The IPS officers provide senior level leadership to Police Forces both in the States and at the Centre.
The Police Division in the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is responsible for all Cadre Control 
and Policy Decisions such as cadre structure, recruitment, training, cadre allocation, confirmation, 
empanelment, deputation, pay and allowances, disciplinary matters of IPS Officers. 
The Service is organized in 24 State cadres, reviewed after every 5 years. 
The Authorized strength of the Indian Police Service Officers stands at 4720 as on 31.12.2010.


Civil List of IPS officers is an updated (annual) list maintained by the Ministry of Home Affairs, 
Government of India that lists the posting details of all IPS officers in India.

SELECTION
IPS officers are recruited from the state police cadres and from the rigorous Civil Services Examination 
conducted by Union Public Service Commission every year.[7] Due to an ongoing shortage of police officers in India,
the Ministry of Home Affairs proposed the creation
of an Indian Police Service Limited Competitive Examination to be conducted by UPSC.
The Civil Services Examination has a three stage competitive selection process.
At stage one, there is an objective type examination called the preliminary exam.
This is a qualifying examination. It consists of a General Studies paper and an aptitude test.
Only the candidates who pass this can appear for the "Main Examination" which consists of nine papers.
Each candidate has to select an optional subject and take six General Studies papers,
an Essay, an English language paper and a regional language paper. This is followed by an interview.
After selection for the IPS, candidates are allocated to a cadre. 
There is one cadre in each Indian state, with the exception of three joint cadres: 
Assam-Meghalaya, Manipur-Tripura, and Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram-Union Territories (AGMUT). 
Two-thirds of the strength of every cadre is filled directly by IPS officers and the remaining 
are promoted from the respective states cadre officers.

Several measures were identified as necessary to professionalise the police in India:

A mid or high ranking police officer must not be transferred more frequently than every two years.
The state government cannot ask the police force to hire someone, nor can they choose the Chief Commissioner.
There must be separate departments and staff for investigation and patrolling.
